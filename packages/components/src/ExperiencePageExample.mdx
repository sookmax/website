This was my first job as a data analyst fresh out of college. With memory still relatively fresh (which is no longer the case), I remember I tried very hard to apply what I'd learned at school to the tasks I was assigned.

It was also this time around that I started developing interest towards computer system behind the scene. You see, when I was in school, my typical IDE was a desktop app called [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) and that was it. But now my IDE was running on [the server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio-server/), and I accessed my RStudio through the browser (as in the form of web app). At that time, this RStudio "server" and the web UI that I can connect and use through the browser felt like dark magic almost ðŸ¤¯. And to control this misterious server&mdash;which was nothing but a desktop PC quietly sitting in the corner of the office&mdash;I had to connect to it through something called an SSH client (I mostly used [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) back then), which would instantly start a Bash session if successfully connected&mdash;it was the first time I interacted with a Linux OS. I was quite fascinated by shell environment of Linux that I would randomly connect to the server just to play around with Bash and its utilites.

It was also the period where big data hype was at its peak, so I had a chance to play a little bit with [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)&mdash;as a matter of fact, Hive was my first experience with SQL.
