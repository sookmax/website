        Things I've been doing since <em>Oct. 2022</em>, which was when I quit
        my last job. The main reason I decided to take a break from work
        altogether was ironically to get better at what I do, that is, web
        development&mdash;it's ironic because I was working as a web developer
        at my last job, but unfortunately found the time I spent at work was not
        too terribly effective at becoming a better web dev.

Well, the original plan was to maintain it with discipline by writing stuff about things related to web development or software engineering at least weekly, which quickly turned out to be a lot more challenging of a task that I'd thought, so I abandoned the idea and moved on shortly after.
