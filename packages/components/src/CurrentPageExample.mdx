        The main reason I decided to take a break from work altogether was

## Teamfight Tactics stats website

There was an online game that I used to enjoy playing&mdash;<a href="https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Teamfight Tactics (TFT)</a>. So naturally I had been checking out <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/apis" target="_blank">Riot's APIs</a> to see if I could create something fun or useful with them. The thing about this particular game is that every now and then (roughly a few months), there's a new "set", and when the new set comes around, the winning strategies you used for the last set wouldn't work on the new set. So you have to sort of learn new strategies for the new set all over again everytime there's a new set. And I wanted to shorten the learning process by analyzing winners' strategies (there are 4 "winners" out of 8 in every TFT game)&mdash;this website was an attempt at that.

## Image gallery with infinite scrolling

I had fun making the image viewer component in <a href="https://image-experiment.vercel.app/" target="_blank">https://image-experiment.vercel.app/</a> so I decided to create a fancier version of it, including skeleton loading animation, transition animations on navigation, swipe gesture support on touch screen, keyboard navigation, infinite scrolling, etc.

I think smooth and well-behaving animations are great to have on any website&mdash;but they are tricky to get right. The animations in this project are mostly taken care of by <a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/" target="_blank">Framer Motion</a>, which is a great animation library, though I had struggled quite a bit trying to orchestrate different animations to work together and ensuring there was no significant performance issue (jankiness / stuttering) on mobile device.

Web animation is a subject that I want to dive deeper and really grasp the fundamentals firmly in the future, so I could rely less on higher level libraries.

## Image experiments with Sanity.io

While I was working on CMS integration for my cousin's website, I learned that <a href="https://www.sanity.io/" target="_blank">Sanity</a> provides various image optimization features for the images uploaded. So I played with the features a little bit, creating a simple website above that has an image viewer.

## Content management system for my cousin's website

I wanted to integrate CMS to my cousin's new website so that he could edit and manage his contents intuitively. I did some research and <a href="https://www.sanity.io/" target="_blank">Sanity</a> looked like a great fit here so I created a tailored Sanity Studio with live editing and preview features for my cousin's website.

(Despite the effort, my cousin doesn't seem to be using the new website and the editor at the moment, whereas it seems he continues to update and maintain his old wix-made website. I guess I lost to wix.com as a website service provider ðŸ˜­)

One of my cousins wanted to renovate the website for the lab he was running (made with wix), so I made him a completely new website, using Next.js and tailwindcss.

## My (now old) personal website

Well, the original plan was to maintain the website with discipline by writing about things related to web development or software engineering on a weekly basis, but it quickly turned out to be a lot more challenging of a task than I'd originally thought, so I abandoned the idea (and the website) and moved on to other stuff shortly after.
